- Closures are a powerful and **fundamental concept** in programming
- Closures are created every time a **function** is created

Here is the official definition of Closures according to MDN (Mozilla Developer Network):  
"A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment)."  

In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function.

- a function must return another function
- the inner function has access to variables from the outer function
- variable value from the outer function is persisted

Let's look at an example:
```js
