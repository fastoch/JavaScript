Node.js with Express and Bun with Hono represent two different approaches to building web applications.  

# Node + Express

## Performance 

While Express has been a reliable framework for years, it's generally slower compared to newer alternatives like Hono running on Bun.  

## Platform support

Express is primarily designed to run on Node.js, which limits its deployment options compared to Hono.  

## Edge computing

Express doesn't have native support for edge computing, which can be a limitation for certain use cases.

# Bun + Hono

## Performance

Bun with Hono offers significantly better performance compared to Node.js with Express.  
Hono is designed to be lightweight and ultra-fast, with optimized routing algorithms that result in faster page loads and improved responsiveness.  

## Platform support

Hono is platform-agnostic and can run on various JavaScript runtimes, including **Bun**, Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute, Deno, and AWS Lambda.   
This flexibility allows developers to choose the best platform for their needs.  

## Edge computing

Hono is built with edge computing in mind, allowing applications to run closer to users and reduce latency.  
This makes it particularly suitable for building globally distributed applications.
