# What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means:
- Existing JavaScript code can be gradually migrated to TypeScript
- TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, so it runs anywhere JavaScript does
- Developers can leverage their existing JavaScript knowledge

# Why do we need TypeScript?

TypeScript adds **static typing** to JavaScript, which helps catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, which leads to fewer bugs making it to production.  

TypeScript is particularly beneficial for large-scale applications:
- It helps manage complex codebases more effectively
- It improves collaboration in teams by making code more predictable
- It provides a more robust structure for growing projects

While TypeScript isn't strictly necessary for small projects, it can significantly improve code quality, maintainability, and developer experience.
The static typing and additional features it provides help create more robust and scalable codebases, making it a valuable tool for many development teams.
