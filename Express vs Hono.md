# What is Express?

Express.js is the most popular web framework for Node.js.  
It is designed for building web applications and APIs and has many features such as handling requests, middleware, and routing.

# What is Hono?

Hono is a modern web framework for Node.js that has been gaining popularity as an alternative to Express.js.  
Hono boasts impressive performance benchmarks, often outperforming Express in terms of raw speed.  

While Express has been criticized for not fully adopting newer web standards like HTTP/2 and HTTP/3,  
Hono has been specifically designed to adhere to modern web standards, offering native support for HTTP/2.   
This native support greatly improves performance, making Hono an excellent choice for developers seeking optimal efficiency.  

Hono is designed to work with various JavaScript runtimes, including Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, Bun, and Deno.  
This flexibility allows developers to deploy Hono applications in **edge computing** environments and newer JavaScript runtimes.  

Hono provides **native TypeScript support** out of the box, offering enhanced code maintainability and developer productivity.  
While TypeScript can be used with Express, it often requires additional configuration.  
Just like Node.js requires additional config for using TypeScript while Bun natively supports it.
