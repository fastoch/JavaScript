## Goal & Web Technologies

Build a full stack modern React App using the following Web technologies:
- In the back-end, we're going to be using **Bun** and the **Hono** framework
-

### Bun

Bun is an all-in-one **JavaScript runtime** and **toolkit** that aims to streamline and enhance JavaScript and TypeScript development.  
Bun is a **fast** JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js.  
It's written in **Zig** and powered by **JavaScriptCore**, offering significantly faster startup times and reduced memory usage compared to Node.js.  

- Bun includes a **Node.js-compatible package manager** that's faster than existing tools
- It can **bundle** JavaScript and **TypeScript** code for browsers, Node.js, and other platforms
- Bun can directly execute .jsx, .ts, and .tsx files **without additional configuration**
- Bun provides a **built-in test runner** for executing unit tests
- It supports both **ES** modules and **CommonJS**
- Bun **implements standard Web APIs** like fetch, WebSocket, and ReadableStream

### Hono

Hono is a lightweight and ultrafast **web framework** designed for building applications across various JavaScript runtimes, including:
- Cloudflare Workers,
- AWS Lambda,
- Deno,
- Bun,
- and Node.js.

Its primary focus is on performance and simplicity, making it an appealing choice for developers looking to create efficient cloud-native applications.  

Hono boasts a **fast routing mechanism**, utilizing a **RegExpRouter** that performs route matching efficiently without linear loops, which contributes to its speed.  

The framework is minimalistic, with the hono/tiny preset being under 14kB in size and having **zero dependencies**, relying solely on Web Standard APIs.  

Hono includes various **built-in middleware** options, such as **authentication**, **CORS**, and **JSON handling**, which facilitate rapid development.  

The framework offers **first-class TypeScript support**, enhancing developer experience through type safety and improved code quality.  

Hono is designed to provide a **delightful development experience** with clean APIs and comprehensive documentation, making it easier for developers 
to get started and build applications quickly.  

In conclusion, Hono is particularly well-suited for **modern web applications** that require speed and efficiency, making it a **strong alternative to** 
more established frameworks like **Express**.js, especially in **edge computing** scenarios.
