# Definition

A JavaScript framework is a pre-written collection of JavaScript code libraries that provides developers with a structured foundation for building web applications.  

# Core Characteristics

- **Pre-written Code**: Frameworks offer reusable code for common programming tasks, eliminating the need to write everything from scratch
- **Structure and Organization**: They provide guidelines and rules for organizing and structuring web applications
- **Efficiency**: Frameworks enable faster and more efficient development of complex applications

# Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Many modern frameworks support breaking down UIs into reusable components
- **MVC Pattern**: Frameworks often use the Model-View-Controller design pattern to separate application logic
- **Performance Optimization**: They are designed to handle data efficiently and improve application performance.

# Framework vs. Library

While often used interchangeably, there's a distinction between:
- **Framework**: Provides a complete structure for application development
- **Library**: Offers specific functionalities that can be used as needed

# Conclusion

JavaScript frameworks significantly simplify web development by providing pre-built solutions for common tasks, allowing developers to focus on unique aspects of their projects.
