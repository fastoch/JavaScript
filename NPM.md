- Node Package Manager (npm) is a command-line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js.
- There are many open-source packages available on npm, so before starting a project, take some time to explore so you don't end up
  recreating the wheel for things like working with dates or fetching data from an API.
- Managing packages with npm is done through a specific file called `package.json`
